This is where you can find images to use for your encryption

You'll notice a file called chimp.png. Even though this program is not made for .png,
short and carefully crafted messages do work with other filetypes.

However, due to the nature of lossless and lossy compressions, if your message is too big, it WILL break.
For consistently long messages, you should be able to use .ppm files.
To convert .png to .ppm on Linux do this:
convert file.png file.ppm
Its that easy.
