This is the Ruby version of the script!
It was a bit rushed so it might not work as well as the others, I haven't had extensive time to test.

Regardless, it was a relatively painless and quick code compared to the others, so thats sweet.
Also this one has a feature the others usually don't: It prompts you for the message!
